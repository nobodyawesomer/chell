Eventually, this may evolve into some sort of lightweight custom shell/ftp with a wire protocol.

For now though, I'm starting off with a basic client-server chat app.

If I stall on this and you have a better idea for the package name, don't hesitate to message me and I would be happy to discuss handing it over.
